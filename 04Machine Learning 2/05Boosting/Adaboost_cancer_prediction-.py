# In this lab, you’ll explore the breast cancer dataset and try to train the model to predict if the person is having breast cancer or not. We will start off with a weak learner, a decision tree with maximum depth = 2.
#
# We will then build an adaboost ensemble with 50 trees with a step of 3 and compare the performance with the weak learner.
#
# Let's get started by loading the libraries.
